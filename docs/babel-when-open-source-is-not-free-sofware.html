              <strong>TLDR;</strong> Babel is the most relied upon software in the Node.JS ecosystem, yet it leaves out ridiculous bugs that take away essential user <strong>freedoms</strong> such as an ability to write <em>JSDoc</em>, while its owners get paid up to $10k a month for maintenance and attending events. <em>TypeScript</em> also comes for free, but also has bugs of the same nature that make developers switch to the OOP ideology that is characterised by self-righteous "Open Source" community who feel free to lash out on everyone who disagrees with them. My simple software offers solutions to restore the <strong>freedom</strong> of the development process. It's aim is not to become popular and known, but to help people program freely.</span>

            <p>When you are studying a particular topic, and become interested in a certain area of this vast world, not only you actively find more information and opinions, but so it happens that bits of the puzzle actually find you in a completely random and unexpected ways. One of this bits was a blog post <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2019/06/13/My-journey-from-MIT-to-GPL.html">
              "My Personal Journey From MIT To GPL"</a>, that I came across I don't even know how. Despite the randomness of the encounter, this article had a tremendous impact on me: I finally started to understand the significance of differences in Open Source licensing models, but more crucially, I was ready to discover other knowledge related to the same topic, that is, the meaning of Open Source and its relation to freedoms.</p>

            <p>In short, the difference between MIT, which I put on all of my packages just because that's how I'd been doing it from day one by following the lead of all other packages that did the same, and GPL is that anyone can take a piece of MIT work, use it in proprietary software, and start selling it for cash without any responsibilities to the author (other than retaining the copyright notice and license copy), whereas GPL requires them to publish the source code of all derived products that link to GPL-licensed code (linking means using as a dependency). This point didn't really come home until I realised, that the <em>permissive</em> MIT license allowed corporate entities to not just use my work in their work, but make a product out of what I'd invested hours of coding into, and then compete with me! That's probably not such a big risk, until you accumulate a large code base that actually makes a difference to your business operations.</p>
            
            <p>That's why I'm now releasing my software under AGPL as well ("<strong>A</strong>" meaning that it can't be installed on a server for SaaS purposes either). However, it's not this decision that is the main point of this section, but the fact that after browsing web in search for more info on licensing, I discovered the GNU website which outlines the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">
              Free Software Foundation philosophy</a>, that confirmed my suspicions that there is a difference between Open Source, and Free software. In one sentence, what everyone should remember is that <strong>free</strong> is used to highlight essential human freedoms and rights, such as:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>freedom of expression;</li>
              <li>right for privacy &mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_8_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights">
              Article 8</a> of the European Convention of Human Rights;</li>
              <li>right for data protection &mdash; <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-1/">recital 1 of the GDPR</a>;</li>
              <li>and others.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Open Source does not really mean that software which anyone can download and which has its source code released for public is free in humanist terms.</p>
            
            <p>As they say, the biggest feat of Devil is that he convinced the world he doesn't exist. Same with Open Source: the myth is that just because software is made by a "community" of developers without being paid in traditional ways, just because anyone is allowed to fork it and upgrade it, and just because it can be very popular, everyone must believe that such software is quality, good and free. The Open Source Initiative puts it that "<em>the promise of open source is better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in</em>". Now I'm going to prove to you that one of the most installed, essential and well-known Node.JS packages, <span class="tm">babel</span> achieves exactly opposite objectives while justifying its shortcomings by referring to the "Open Source" label.</p>

            <p>That's the title of <a href="https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8432">an issue that I opened</a> in <em>Babel</em>'s repository after I found out one of the most devastating bugs in the entire <em>Node.JS</em> ecosystem. I already wasn't happy with having to use a dependency with 230+ transient dependencies for every package that I created just because I liked the <span class="tm">import</span> syntax and believed that it was essential to follow the modern day standard. Although with an SSD and fibre-optics it doesn't take that long to download and link all of those dependencies, in summer I sort of down-shifted from Sky to mobile 3G and became conscious of inbound/outbound data, as well as worked on an older iMac with a standard hard drive. Therefore, each real dependency took a few minutes to install due to all linking that had to be done against babel's dependencies (the <span class="tm">linking N...</span> number actually grows exponentially). But what I found about in August 2018, really upset me.</p>

            <p>The code looks ugly but since every JS developer trusts Babel so much (why not, the fact that it's got 8m+ downloads per week means it's reliable, doesn't it?), there's no need to ever look into the "build" folder. Can you spot any problems with that code?.. It's OK if not, I couldn't either, and that was partly because I'm using <em>VS Code</em> as my IDE. No issues can be seen when requiring source for testing within the package directory, since <em>JSDoc</em> annotations to functions work fine when importing ES6 source code for testing. Problems only start after publishing the package, installing it in other packages, and requiring the TRANSPILED code in them.</p>

            <p>So what's actually happened here? Well, in the first instance, arguments for the default <span class="tm">TechNation</span> import are shown only because <em>VS Code</em> infers the type using the <strong>NAME</strong> of the variable in the target source, rather than understanding what's actually exported/imported. The fact that it's broken when the name changes proves that. The editor doesn't know what the default import is, it just knows the name of the variable and does the Maths. It's quite difficult to come across this, because typically the name of the default export is also the name of the default import. It was only when I imported a variable using a different name that I noticed it wasn't working. This bug has been fixed since TypeScript 3.2 (October 2018) after my <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/25854">bug report</a> by TypeScript checking for the assignment of <span class="tm">__esModule</span> and picking up the <span class="tm">default</span> export. Nonetheless, the IDE still doesn't show hints for the <span class="tm">sucks</span> method. Why?</p>

              <li>I'm passionate and obsessional about quality;</li>
              <li>I finally understood why <em>JSDoc</em> was not showing in the editor properly for my own packages;</li>
              <li>There's nobody who would tell them off for that offense, there's no Open Source quality assurance commission that would shame an essential piece of <em>Node.JS</em> infrastructure for how they treated me and my work.

            <p>It finally established my attitude towards so-called "community" where no responsibility is ever taken by anyone and my <strong>freedom</strong> of writing documentation using <em>JSDoc</em> was taken away from me by software that pretty much extorted me into using it because of lack of alternatives and <em>Node.JS</em>'s inability to JUST make ES6 modules happen. Let's have a look at the the first comment from a maintainer on that issue:</p>

                  Your previous issue was closed because its tone was insulting. This one is too: it's not just about avoiding all-caps. Babel is used by thousands of production-grade projects, many of which use doc comments to generate their documentation. With a bit of humility, you may have recognized that maybe you are missing something instead of immediately calling the maintainers incompetent.<br><br>
                  Now, to answer you issue: the output you see is expected behavior (<strong>Edit</strong>: See below, I agree that it's worse than in Babel 6). Output generated by Babel is no longer source code (by definition, it's generated content): it is not intended to act as source code. Comments are emitted on a best effort basis to help readability when debugging the output file. Babel output should be treated similarly to machine code: you do not generate documentation from machine code but from the source.<br><br>
                  The input you pass to your documentation generation tool should be the the source code with ES-next syntax, not the lowered Babel output.

            <p>My reply was that I wasn't calling the <em>maintainers</em> incompetent, but all people who blindly make religion out of Babel without knowing what they are doing (<em>though it's what I was also doing, but then I stopped, whereas have you?</em>). The comment was marked as disruptive and fair enough. You can talk to the person mentioned here and he'll confirm that I reached out to him and apologized for overflow of emotions. In the "disruptive" comment I only made it clear that he misunderstood the point that I made regarding <em>JSDoc</em> blocks (hence <em>edit</em> in his comment) and that it's not generated documentation that suffered, but actual transpiled code. But he says himself <strong>Babel is used by thousands of production-grade projects, many of which use doc comments to generate their documentation</strong>!!! There's no better words than - What the **** Babel -. <em>demurgos</em> continues:</p>

            <p>OK perhaps I'm not entitled to support unless I contribute moneys, but the <a href="https://opencollective.com/babel">Open Collective</a> page states that 2 hours of support goes only to the most advanced contribution tier, called "Base Support Sponsor" for $24k a year. OK Babel you've charged <em>AirBnb</em> and <em>AMP</em> for 4 hours of your support $4k in August ($1k per hour, but that's none of my business really how much you charge for support, I'm actually happy you can do that, what I'm mad about is how you betray trust of all other people who contribute money without being entitled to support), so the rest $19k must have been spent on maintenance, such as fixing bugs?</p>

              Looking at it closer, this seems to be a regression introduced during the Babel 7 beta.<br>
              A simple workaround would be to use a stable version of Babel (Babel 6).<br>
              It's not good that this regression happened, but it's why Babel 7 is still in <strong>beta</strong>. Thanks for reporting issues on the beta release, but there's <strong>no need to get mad if you use unstable versions</strong>. This will probably be fixed until the stable release.

            <p>I will abstain from commenting further because then this entire page will have to be marked as "disruptive", towards both "volunteers" (maintainers <small>cashing in 10k a month khm-khm each</small>) and contributors willing to pay this money for such reliable software. Is it really wrong of me to show negative attitude towards this state of affairs? Just one last thing I want to bring up here, is that the Babel's maintainers get "to be involved in the process that moves various JavaScript proposals forward" (Open Collective's landing). Yet we have bugs like that. I believe it's essential to have traditional values met first, before working on proposals, and <em>Babel</em> was responsible however it failed. For comparison, <strong>Bootstrap</strong> <a href="https://opencollective.com/bootstrap">receives</a> only £3k yearly, arguably being the second most important piece of the web infrastructure after <em>Babel</em>. A picture is worth a thousand words:</p>

            <p>Going back to the <em>the promise of open source is better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in</em>, so far we can draw the following conclusions:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Better quality</strong> is not a thing since <em>JSDoc</em> is essential to the development process. You can't not have functions annotated properly (<span class="tm">@param</span>, an occasional <span class="tm">@example</span>) if you publish your package. A transpiler MUST keep <em>JSDoc</em> in the proper place, if it doesn't that means the transpiler is of low-quality since it doesn't even have tests for <em>JSDoc</em>.</li>
              <li><strong>Higher reliability</strong> is a myth because even though the issue was filed, with screenshots and explanations, it was ignored totally for the amount of time equal to one year, even after the software went out of beta-testing.</li>
              <li><strong>Lower cost</strong> is actually higher, because installing <em>Babel</em> will increase the <span class="tm">npm install</span> duration of each new dependency for up to a 20-30s, and much more on hard drives (compared to SSD). Say 5 installs a day of new packages in a team of 5 people, that's 12 minutes a day and an hour a week wasted on looking at the "linking dependencies..." message.</li>
              <li>and finally, perhaps the most unintuitively, <strong>an end to predatory vendor lock-in</strong> becomes...</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            </div>

            <h2 id="the-start-of-predatory-vendor-lock-in">The Start Of Predatory Vendor Lock-In</h2>
            
            <p>First of all, if you're using <em>Babel</em> you already know that you don't have freedom. You'd want not to have install a transpiler, when since Node 8 you only use it for modules. As I mentioned earlier, that's entirely Node.JS fault, who should have treated import as require and export as module.export long ago instead of splitting the hair around the specification of how modules should actually work. However, I'm really happy this all happened since every obstacle is an opportunity to create something new which is independent, better, and more unique. But what other negative effect does <em>Babel</em> have on the ecosystem and the development of JavaScript by breaking <em>JSDoc</em>?</p>
            
            <p>The answer is that without properly working <em>JSDoc</em>, people are tempted to use <strong>TypeScript</strong> &mdash; the grandest evil that you will ever encounter today. I know this because that's how I felt when I struggled with my <em>JSDoc</em>, when it wasn't working. I thought, OMG things are just not working, if I just used typings, that would solve all my problems! And I'm sure that's how other developers feel as well. But once you make this decision, there is no road back, you become hostage to the most overrated technology ever, that was made by Microsoft and a) makes you addicted to typing every singe thing b) tells you that apparently that's how you scale up, i.e. fear-mongering that without it your large project will fail, c) basically does what the heading of this section says, that is locks you in TypeScript, because the more code you write in TypeScript, the less likely you will go back to pure JavaScript, and d) turns you into a close-minded zombie ready to defend TypeScript at any price because it's too much psychological pain to admit that you're now hooked on technology, rather than using technology for your own means.</p>
            
            <p>TypeScript is too unnecessary for a duck-typed programming language. Because people learn Java at universities, they will want to use TypeScript, forgetting that JavaScript is basically a functional programming language. <span class="tm2">.Map</span>, <span class="tm2">.reduce</span>, <span class="tm2">.filter</span>, these are the pillars of the web development, not types. Types are just there to make life convenient, it's a tool but TypeScript makes them the aim in itself. You can achieve everything you need with <em>JSDoc</em>, but software like <em>Babel</em> makes it impossible, and I have a slight suspicion (any fellow conspiracy theorists?) that Microsoft secretly encourage <em>Babel</em> to keep this awful bug. Although it's just a speculation, it is based on the fact that Microsoft also break <em>JSDoc</em> capabilities and don't want to fix them, openly stating that people should switch to TypeScript, instead of MS fixing bugs. Proof or get out? OK then, here's your proof.</p>

            <p>I don't really care what powers <em>VS Code</em>, I NEED <em>JSDoc</em> to work. I have the <strong>freedom of expression</strong> of my documentation. And sure, much better experience. Just stop lying, all the experience that I want can be (and has been) easily achieved with <em>JSDoc</em>. You just want to convert as many people into <em>TypeScript</em> . Still, people would argue that because <em>TypeScript</em> is Open Source, it's good. Not it isn't and if there's one thing that I want to convey on this page, is that Open Source doesn't mean free, not in a sense that it gives or protects your freedoms. Much otherwise, to be honest, a lot of software take the freedom away by providing low-quality solutions and introducing bugs that are then used against you so that you become a consumer of technology you don't even need. Using <em>TypeScript</em> instead of <em>JSDoc</em> for Node.<strong>JS</strong> programming is like treating a scratch with surgery when you just need to apply a plaster.</p>
            
            <p>Instead of just being a hater of everything and everyone, I went on and implemented a tool called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/typal"><em>Typal</em></a> that could be used to embed <em>JSDoc</em> documentation into source code automatically from a separate XML file. It is also part of the <em>NodeTools</em> stack and is needed for other requirements, such as making externs compilation as I will show in another article. I then published information about it <a href="https://medium.com/@art_deco/how-to-ditch-typescript-for-jsdoc-212ff1978542">on Medium</a>. The first response that I got gave me an incredible amount of joy:</p>

I only got a C in my first-language English in my first year in England, after all, I'm not gonna deny I'm a stoopid. I hope Medium does not sue me for not matching the "Supposed level of professionalism that Medium is supposed to represent". O-M-G. And the truth is, if I wrote how much I love <em>TypeScript</em>, added a simple tutorial of how I just switched all of my code to it, and then praised Microsoft for liberating us from <em>JSDoc</em>, I would have got 10000 claps. Although what gives me hope is that there were people who gave me a few claps also so I know developers are keen on being liberated from this tyrannical OOP ideology and its followers, feeling so free and secure to shame anyone who thinks differently, and that's exactly what my software achieves &mdash; gives actual freedom. You will learn more about types and <em>Typal</em> in one of the next articles.</p>

            <p>After all, I do use <em>VS Code</em> and it's kind of really good (except for when it lags when I create new files and starts side-bar search as a reaction to typing the intended filename). I don't mind building my own JavaScript Node.JS IDE one day (it will be called <em>Moderne</em> and it would be something like Dreamweaver but with JSX components for easy visual editing as well as more nuanced coding), but I have to admit that <em>TypeScript</em> succeeded and pushed the <em>JSDoc</em> state-of-art forward in two directions:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><span class="tm">@type {import('package').Type}</span> statements. That's brilliant and gets rid of the need to actually import ES6 modules to annotate types, which is sometimes not even possible (think circular dependencies). <em>Google Closure Compiler</em> needs to learn to understand this syntax, and I hope one day I'll have enough time one day to work on that. There's also the same bug as above but regarding importing typedefs at level 2+, therefore all types need to be imported in <span class="tm">index.js</span>, and only from there in other files.</li>
              <li><span class="tm">@type {TypeA &amp; TypeB}</span> unions. This is also crucial and important because otherwise there's no way to annotate "extends" functionality.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These annotations can be written in pure JS, without having to write <em>TypeScript</em> since they are just comments. Things that are not possible without <em>TypeScript</em> which should be possible:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Annotating types of even listeners, e.g., <span class="tm">on(event: &quot;close&quot;, listener: () =&gt; void): this;</span>.</li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30940">Overloading of methods</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This praise still doesn't mean that keeping bugs that prevent proper working of <em>JSDoc</em> in the IDE, not implementing essential <em>JSDoc</em> features such as overloading, and then openly telling me to switch to <em>TypeScript</em> justifies the "FOSS"-iness of <em>VS Code</em>. In the age of capitalism, why would a corporation invest time and labour resources into developing a product? Or you think that apart from monetary gain, there is no secondary rewards such as wiring developers brains on subconscious level for a particular frequency expressed in an attitude towards a company? In case of a programming language, this wiring goes so deep because you literally express yourself using the language, and what's the first thing that comes to mind when you think <em>TypeScript</em>, your daily tool that earns you your daily bread? That's right, <em>Microsoft</em>. For some people that's fine, but not for all of us. Maybe I'm hypocritical when I don't associate VS Code with Microsoft but oh well you caught me here I just don't like <em>TypeScript</em>. Finally, I must admit that I fell into <em>TypeScript</em> trap in my first industry year, and thought "this is how programming should be done" because of a lot of <em>Java</em> coding, but that affair was quickly put to an end by my manager so many kudos to him.</p>
             
            So thank you GNU for putting it so clearly, that free software protects <strong>human freedoms</strong> of users, rather than comes for free.

            <h2 id="code--la-mode">Code À La Mode</h2>
            
            <p><em>Code À La Mode</em> is one of company names that I came up when thinking of names for my software company, prior to getting the <em>Art Deco™</em> insight. What I wanted to convey from the very beginning, is that modern code is beautiful, eloquent and practical. ES6 modules, async syntax and destructuring are the best features of JS, because they are so straight to the point as to what their purpose is, and just handsome to look at.</p>
            
            <p>So after the final tipping point with <em>Babel</em> I took some time to write my own transpiler, since that idea had long been in my head prior to that. But building ASTs, traversing them and generating code is too much effort. Programming must be practical, and like the language, solve problems at hand rather than build sand castles around standards and stuff. The second approach to transpilation is to actually use regular expressions, because imports are pretty much requires:</p>
            
            <pre id="ccdbf9"><code class="javascript hljs">import ArtDeco from      '@artdeco/stdlib'
const  ArtDeco = require('@artdeco/stdlib')

import { artdeco } from      '@artdeco/stdlib'
const  { artdeco } = require('@artdeco/stdlib')

import ArtDeco, { artdeco } from '@artdeco/stdlib'
const ArtDeco =         require ('@artdeco/stdlib'); const { artdeco } = ArtDeco</code></pre>
            
            <p>and exports are almost the same as assignments:</p>
            
            <pre id="ccdbf10"><code class="javascript hljs">export default class ArtDeco {}
module.exports =     ArtDeco {}

export const artdeco = () = {}
     exports.artdeco = () = {}</code></pre>
            
            <p>What's the point of all this intellectual exercise of making up random requirement like what the ES6 modules standard is for <em>Node.JS</em> when all you have to do is to read the source code from a separate file? It probably is important in a browser, but who's ever going to use something like "async namespaces" in Node? Sure, regular expressions are probably not as robust as ASTs, but they also don't require installing 4k dependencies, and can be run in literally milliseconds! I've transpiled 100s of packages with <em>ÀLaMode</em> now, and the only problem I encountered is due to the fact that I implemented it in such a way as to cut out comments, strings and regular expressions first, then paste them back to prevent false-positives, but when you have something like <code>const a = &#96;https://test.com&#96;</code> you might have a problem because the transpiler removes the comment first, and the opening backtick does not get balanced with its counter part, so that if there is another template literal later on in the file, what's between them will not be transpiled. OK that might be frustrating that it's not 100% accurate, but it's 100% practical, and I know of a way to overcome that, I just couldn't be bothered when all I can do is to write <code>'https:/' + '/test.com'</code>, or even better <code>url.format({ protocol: 'http', hostname: 'test.com' })</code> (since I had to use backticks, that means that the URL string needs to be formatted).</p>

            <p>Which one looks better? Again, the <strong>freedom</strong> to just transpile code with minimal changes to enable modules which Node.JS cannot do, is taken away by <em>Babel</em> that thinks it is entitled to append <span class="tm">;</span>, prepend <span class="tm">use strict;</span>, insert random interops, rearrange code and break <em>JSDoc</em>. So instead of just letting us use beautiful <code>import</code> syntax for the simplest task of dependency injection, <em>Node.JS</em> and <em>Babel</em> provoke a situation where we must use <del>free</del> software when its authors, who travel the world lobbying for standards, tell us you how we all must think. To clarify the comment below, the author is saying that I can configure the <code>use strict</code> in config, but if I use the modules transform, it is enabled automatically (and the way to disable it <a href="https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/7910">is not documented</a>). In other words, even if I KNOW my code will be transpiled, I can't use <code>imports</code> in a non-strict file only because it's not a standard. All this standards-worshipping is so annoying.</p>

            <p>I'm a strong advocate of practical programming, which means that you should not stuff your head with paradigms, methodologies and principles, and then go out of your way to follow them, even though they slow down the development process. For example, when I worked in London, "semantic commit messages" was introduced. This means that every commit should start with something like <span class="tm">fix: bla-bla</span>, <span class="tm">test: bla-bla</span>, and apparently because it's a convention, it's good. We even had it enforced with a git-hook that would add red cross if the message wasn't following the standard. But what happened was, when you published a package, you would get an automatic commit with <span class="tm">v1.2.3</span> by NPM or yarn, and when uploaded to GitHub, that would give you a red cross. So for those cases, developers had to undo the versioning commit, and update it with <span class="tm">chore: v1.2.3</span> message. That wasted at least 20s of everyone's time again and again.</p>

            <p>I do write some descriptions, but if it's a changelog it's like <span class="tm">c123</span>, a build &mdash; just <span class="tm">b</span>, some docs &mdash; <span class="tm">doc</span>, when I can't be asked it's <span class="tm">.</span> (I can't remember where I saw it but there was a repo of quite a big project where entire history of commits consisted of just <span class="tm">.</span>). I'm sure that's how most people do it as well on a single-person repo, but if you are still bothered with PRs, merges and proper English descriptions in your commits, you might consider using the time on adding a few additional tests/examples instead. I understand that it's not entirely appropriate for repos with more than one maintainer, my point being exactly that if you're doing it for yourself, don't create obstacles that will slow you down for no reason other than "conventions".</p>

Firstly, even without those operations the library that I wrote wasn't allowed to go through initially because of the fear that it might leave a possibility for SQL injection, despite the fact that it was only to be used for internal purposes. Secondly, if I just used an existing library which apparently was safe, I would have never been able to add the recursive functionality, which is essential when you want to create a testing database, then instead of dropping and bootstrapping it all over again for each test, you could just clear it, clear only a part of it, or even select a slice of the state for snapshot. Without recursive select/delete, you can't do that (recursive means that when you have a campaign with a client_id as foreign key, you can select a nested structure in one query, or delete both records without running into a constraint). However, the feature wasn't being merged in because of  caution that one of developers will one day drop an entire production database, with links being sent to <a

            <p>I don't think that it's possible that a 100GB production DB could have been accidentally dropped, because the recursive select for delete would probably take a few days to complete if the server didn't even blow up prior to that. So my reviewer and I met somewhere in the middle by adding a regex check against a part of the url-string of the prod database. Although it was a really good idea of my peer-reviewer that actually gave sense of security to everyone, I don't believe it's <ins>always</ins> "better safe than sorry", and sometimes too much fear stagnates and slows down the process. If the database was deleted, then there should be a process to quickly find out about it and put it back. Advantages need to be properly weighed against risks rather than assigning 100% red alert to every piece of code that deletes something.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <p>As you could already have grasped, <strong>freedom</strong> is what I live for, and happiness for me is when your mind is free not only from outside influences, opinions, commentaries, but also from deep-rooted believes and "common sense" that we consider our own. When I passed out in the kitchen after a sleepless night without having any meals and opened my eyes to see the washing machine in front of me, completely disoriented, I was totally happy, I was blissful beyond words, because I didn't know where or who I was. It's pretty sad I have to pass out to be happy but it's what it is for most of us depressed humans. Then your mind kicks back in and takes over and you become its hostage to fear, anger (e.g., when such villains as <em>Tech Nation</em> ruin your life) and other societal wirings. I always give this example and I feel sad for all so-called scholars/theologists who make theories about the nature of the world just to become prisoners of a virtual system &mdash; they will never know what happiness really is. Happiness is <strong>freedom</strong>, not freedom to choose, but freedom from the choices that we make (occasionally, I'd say somethings smart of funny and then feel like I stole that so pardon me if it's so 😔).</p>
            
            <p>So I would suggest people start feeling less constrained by standards' apparition in order to go beyond what's normal and find out something <em>really</em> new. OK let's get concrete now and how it all relates to software in question. The problem with not generating ASTs to build a transpiler, is that the professional software development for a mature project goes the following:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>go into your tests, and add a test case, i.e., the scenario that you want to either fix, or make possible;</li>
              <li>then continue to implementation and add a rough sketch of how you think it can work. Do as much coding from head as you can without running the program;</li>
              <li>run the focused test, see it fail with an error;</li>
              <li><strong>Set the debugging point at where it fails</strong>, and start the debugger;</li>
              <li>when the debugger pauses, check the contents of variables, properties, <em>etc</em> and see how the state of the program is different from what you expected when sketching it;</li>
              <li>update the code, save it and your test should automatically rerun;</li>
              <li>iterate; then run all tests to ensure nothing else broke (regression testing).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You DON'T debug with <span class="tm">console.log</span>, manually calling <span class="tm">node program.js</span> after each change. <span class="tm">console.log</span> is only for really limited cases like when forking a process (even then VS Code apparently <a
              href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2018/07/12/introducing-logpoints-and-auto-attach#_autoattaching-to-node-processes">
              can auto-attach</a> to a fork on the same debugging port but I never got that working). I know for some people that's obvious, but many developers don't know how to use debugger which is essential.</p>
            
            <p>But the problem you will run into when using a regex-based transpiler, is that you cannot generate source maps, because a <a href="https://blog.bugsnag.com/source-maps/">source map is a collection of mappings</a> of <strong>entries</strong> in source code to <strong>entries</strong> in the transpiled code, entries being variable names, properties, operators and everything else. Without this information, you can't have a source map, and without source map, when you debug in <em>VS Code</em>, your debugger won't open the source file, it will open the transpiled file in the read-only mode. You can't work like that and be efficient at the development process outlined above.</p>

            <p>Therefore, to generate a source map, you need to have an AST. Or do you? The answer is not necessary. I watched the news the other day, and there was an International Olympiad in Informatics happening recently. Olympic programming is a special kind of programming, you need to be like really smart, know all these algorithms, their Θ-s (running time as function of size of data) and how to solve algorithmic problems, so that's for special people with high IQ. I don't think I have high IQ, but solving problems in web-computing comes natural during a creative process, so practical coding is definitely more about being artistic and making something sleek by applying simple solutions that achieve results. You don't need to be smart, you just need to think outside the box and dismiss standards. The true task is to find a simple solution because there always is one.</p>

            <summary>
              So if we need a mapping, but don't have AST how do we go about solving this?</summary>
            The answer is that we need to keep the line and column numbers intact when updating the imports into requires, so that then each line can be split by whitespace, and pretty much mapped onto itself! That's the only way to do it.<br>

            <p>If when developing the transpiler, I was restricted by such thoughts as "but regexes won't have 100% coverage" or "I will have to make sure the interoperability follows the specification" and all the rest of the nonsense, I would not be able to achieve my only aim, that is, use <code>import</code> instead of require because it looks so handsome. And having my own ES6 modules transpiler, allowed me to build the JSX transpiler also &mdash; obviously that's not possible if you just use somebody else's software. The joy of being an indie developer!</p>

                  While most of my modules also work in the browser, I make them mainly for Node.js. I love how dependencies in Node.js just work (1) without having to resort to a bundler, compile-step, and a huge config file. ... The web on the other hand is a mess.  ... It would also be hard for individual packages to know what Babel (2) config to use.

              <li>Although <code>import</code> is a language feature since 2015, many people, including top Node.JS Open Source developers, use <span class="tm">require</span> because it just works. This is also true for other packages such as Koa, Express, <em>etc</em>.</li>
              <li>Babel IS de-facto what powers the web and you know that, you can't live without Babel.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>For me, keeping using <span class="tm">require</span> is not a solution when I can see how pretty <code>imports</code> are. It's like still using callbacks/promises when you can use async. Why should we all be limited in expressing ourselves using the richness of our language only because of outdated infrastructure that we have?</p>
            
            
            
            
            So I commented on the post, "Epic I don't want to transpile anything as I also write for Node :P <strong>@sindresorhus</strong> you can use import and export in your packages without Babel by installing my regex-based transpiler alamode: https://github.com/a-la/alamode! It's super-fast, has a require hook and works without building any AST! You can even debug with no problems." Then I explained the bug in <em>Babel</em>.

            </p>
            
            <p>That really ticked me off. If I was a revered <em>Node.JS</em> star, and somebody commented on one of my issues on GitHub, showing how <em>Babel</em> is destroying JSDoc, I think I would have been like "Oh OK thank you brother/sister, I'll probably keep using <code>require</code> but thanks for your work!". It was the <a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/csv-parser/pull/91">second time</a> when I showed off my work which nobody wanted, and then I vowed never to give a crap about my packages getting downloads ever again. I knew I was doing all this work for MYSELF, not for anyone. I would greatly appreciate if you skip giving me stars on <em>GitHub</em> I really don't care. The work I've done is for my company first of all, and for the community secondly, but only community that can appreciate the importance of <em>JSDoc</em>, not community that for years doesn't see how <em>Babel</em> is ruining it.</p>
            
            <p>I only had one thought in my head, it was "it's just packages mate, just packages"... Although I do realise, that the language that I used was not appropriate, I said "🔩 (scr**) corporate Babel" and I have to issue an apology for this rude language to everyone, it's not great to talk like that. But the meaning of this word is "used to express anger or contempt" and I had nothing less than contempt for <em>Babel</em>, an essential piece of <em>Node.JS</em> ecosystem that EVERYONE depends on, whose authors can't write a single test for <em>JSDoc</em>. Open Source: because everyone can be a professional Software Developer on the internet.</p>

              To be noble</a>, one’s response to suffering, in oneself as much as in others, must not be to alleviate it, but to use it in becoming greater still. The noble person suffers greatly but is unwilling to cease their commitment to being great. Nor will they invite pity. So they will not try to display their suffering, but will hide it behind a mask, e.g. a mask that treats all suffering casually (§270).</summary>
                  The terrible suffering of the higher person, and the herd morality that encourages the alleviation of suffering, means they often come to ruin (§269). They need to forget what they know about life and themselves, their contempt and revulsion; and so they become seduced by flattery and lose their nobility to become someone ‘great’, revered by the herd.</details>

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>To quickly sum up, it's time to debunk myths that Open Source means free software, that popular packages are good packages, and that JavaScript is deficient because it misses types. Truly free software is the one that cares about you as a developer by honestly attempting to show as little of its presence as possible and letting you do your job rather than dictating how you must work. 4911 linking dependencies, complete negligence to documentation techniques and culture in which it's maintainers of such software who get to participate in conferences and events to lobby for the future of the language pretty much only because we've been extorted to use this software, does not make <em>Babel</em> free.</p>
            
            <p>You don't even need <em>Babel</em> if you code Node.JS (unless for imports) because since Node 8 you have all the Ecma features that are needed - <code>async</code>, destructuring and arrow functions (with an exception of unicode property regexes), yet for some reasons, there are testing frameworks like Ava that advertise the ability to write code in latest proposals as a feature &mdash; who at all needs that? You know I feel like staying on Node 8 forever, it's like ditching a smartphone for a simpler phone. It's like a game, to ditch all too technological things in life: you start by thinking "but I've <em>always needed it</em>" and then you receive your liberation because of realisation that everything in life is artificial apart from soul, face-to-face communication and your human integrity.</p>
            
            
            
             
            
            
            <p>Moreover, it is the fault of <em>Node.JS</em> who for <a href="https://2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html">5 years</a> could not add <code>imports</code> that we were under tyranny of <em>Babel</em> and <em>TypeScript</em>. Standards don't code programs, people code programs, and it's an important take away that we should not create artificial constraints on ourselves that hamper the development process, and if risk is involved, then proper response mechanisms should be put in place instead of rejecting innovation. To quote Seneca: "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it" and we must use technology as our instruments to achieving our real goals, instead of worshipping the sacredness of our <ins>tools</ins>.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>Another "free" software, <em>TypeScript</em> is completely proprietary because you cannot go anywhere without <span class="tm">tsserver</span> binary. More and more code that you write in TypeScript, take you further and further away from pure <em>JavaScript</em>. Microsoft does not prioritise fixing bugs that prevent proper functioning of <em>JSDoc</em>, such as that types from level 2+ files are not imported which results in poor experience for developers, their confusion and subsequent switch to <em>TypeScript</em> typings. Moreover, instead of admitting the presence of such bugs in <em>VS Code</em> IDE, Microsoft calls for developers to switch to <em>TypeScript</em> to avoid issues. This is not <strong>freedom</strong> &mdash; it's nothing less than vendor lock-in and abuse of trust that developers put in.</p>
            
            <p>I hope that on the other hand, my transpiler, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/alamode,">ÀLaMode</a> can match the criteria of free software because:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>It has 0 dependencies, so that it will not waste developer time for linking of itself and future packages.</li>
            <table style="max-width:100%;">
            <tbody><tr><th>ÀLaMode: 8 yarn.lock lines</th><th>Babel: 1650 yarn.lock Lines</th></tr>

            <li>It does not change anything in source code apart from <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> statements, which looks exactly like a human would write it if they were writing it using require.</li>
            <li>It skips adding any <em>interop</em>s that force their own interoperability standard such as <span class="tm">__esModule</span> notation.</li>
            <li>It solves the problem of easily importing modules, without making a cult out of transpilation and ES6 modules specification.</li>
            <li>It preserves <em>JSDoc</em>, allows to debug programs using a source-map generation hack, and avoids constructing ASTs which is computationally much more expensive than using regular expressions.</li>
            <li>Regarding freedom, using <em>RegExes</em> means that anyone can fork my project and make simple changes (e.g., implement unnamed imports such as <span class="tm">import 'example'</span>) with minimum effort/knowledge, i.e., there's no need to dive deep into compiler theories with its visitor patterns <em>etc</em>.</li>
            
            </ol>
            
            <p>There are some limitations to ÀLaMode, such as it currently does not transpile <code>import 'example'</code> or dynamic imports, or that it might choke on <span class="tm">//</span> inside of template literals. However, it also allows to write <span class="tm">JSX</span> and can replace the locations of imports from <code>import t from 'package'</code> to <code>import t from '../stdlib/package'</code> to creation of 0-dependency packages. These features are subjects of next articles.</p>
            
            <p>I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post hope you don't get the wrong impression about me some bits are personal and in the end I doubted if I should even talk of these things since not everyone will understand &#91;the place I was in &#93; but oh well it's the work that matters, so see you in next posts.
