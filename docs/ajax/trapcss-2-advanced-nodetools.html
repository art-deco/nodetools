During the initialisation process with <span class=\"tm\">mnp</span>, we were asked some questions like if we wanted to compile the package, if a binary should be added and whether <em>GitHub</em> wiki should be created. We answered yes to all three questions, so let's get on with the second part of the tutorial.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"compilation-step\">Compilation Step</h2>\n\nPrior to <em>NodeToos</em>, the industry standard was to simply transpile source code with <em>Babel</em>, or not use module at all and avoid transpilation step together. The first option is not good because <em>Babel</em> is a package with 200+ dependencies that jam our <span class=\"tm\">node_modules</span>, and also because for years it's been disparaging professional software engineering values that are in core of <em>NodeTools</em>, such as respect for <em>JSDoc</em>, as can be read in the <a href=\"/nodetools/babel-when-open-source-is-not-free-sofware.html\">\n   Babel: When Open Source Is Not Free Sofware</a> article.",
