#![##TrapCSS] TrapCSS: NodeTools Tutorial

<!-- <npm-badge package="trapcss" /> -->

There are CSS frameworks such as _Bootstrap_ that allow to create great layouts quickly, however their size might be quite large. This point is worth considering because CSS is loaded in a blocking fashion: the browser will have to wait before all CSS is loaded to render a web site, so large external stylesheets actually slow down page render by postponing first meaningful paint. This affects usability and even search engine ranking negatively. In many cases, a lot of CSS can be "dropped" from frameworks' compiled code by leaving only those selectors that are present on a page, or multiple pages. This technique corresponds to the "Defer unused CSS" Lighthouse [warning](lighthouse).

One of the packages that is able to do it quickly is called [DropCSS](dropcss), developed by [Leon Sorokin](https://github.com/leeoniya). It's notable for its speed, simplicity and the amount of bytes that can shaved off the CSS. However, for our use case it was not perfect: it strips comments and does not allow to keep arbitrary annotations, such as `/* alternate */` which is needed for [Closure Stylesheets](https://github.com/artdecocode/closure-stylesheets-java). Closure Stylesheets is an optimiser of CSS that can minify and put styles together. Art Deco uses it for Splendid, a static website generator. By collecting selectors across all pages on a generated website, we're able to drop unused Bootstrap rules, and then merge Bootstrap with other styles so that a single, small CSS file is served to visitors quickly, with _Bootstrap_ size reduction of around 95%.

But Bootstrap contains rules that repeat the CSS properties, e.g.,:

```css
abbr[title],
abbr[data-original-title] {
  text-decoration: underline;
  -webkit-text-decoration: underline dotted;
  /* @alternate */
  text-decoration: underline dotted;
  /* ^ repeated use, need alternate */
}
```

We needed to annotate Bootstrap with the `/* alternate */` marker so that the CSS compiler doesn't throw an error. A simple proposed solution to prevent stripping such comments was suggested in form of a [PR](https://github.com/leeoniya/dropcss/pull/41) to _DropCSS_ package owner, however was rejected as being too narrow of a use case. Therefore, we decided to fork his project and use its source code to create a professional Node.JS package that would also provide JSDoc annotations, could be tested with context testing, and is ready to be compiled into other packages, such as _Splendid_ itself, so that it's linked statically instead of dynamically as permitted by the original MIT license.

This tutorial walks through the process of upgrading a package to use _NodeTools_ stack with explanation of advantages of using the tools from the stack in creating modern packages. You might want to read the [quick start](quickStart) guide first for some details about the standard routine.
