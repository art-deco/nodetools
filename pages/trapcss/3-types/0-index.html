##! Adding Types

After we've copied the typedef, we'll want to write types that are relevant for our program. The main method accepts a hashmap config, so we'll document its structure in `types/index.xml`.

<highlightjs src="../example/index.xml" />

We're using the `_trapcss` namespace to be able to name our config as `_trapcss.Config` and distinguish it from other packages' configs that can be defined with the same name. The namespace is the feature of _VSCode_ that we use to our advantage, and it's not much different from standard typedefs, only that names of types are preceded with the `_ns`. We also use ``_`` underscore as the convention for namespaces' titles, otherwise there might be conflicts between them and some functions in the source code.

There are 3 main types of types: records, interfaces and constructors. The key point to remember is that records are used for configs and other simple objects passed between programs, while interfaces are used to describe methods and properties on classes, which are then annotated with `/* @implements {_ns.Type} */` in the source code. Unfortunately, _VSCode_ doesn't understand the implements notation and will not allow to "put meat" or grow implementation on the interface defined like that while providing hints during implementation process, but this notation is used to enable _Closure Compiler_ type checking. Some examples of `@implements` can be found in the [Goa server](implements-example).

```js
/**
 * @implements {_goa.Application}
 */
export default class Application extends EventEmitter {
  /**
   * Initialize a new `Application`.
   * @param {!_goa.ApplicationOptions} options
   */
  constructor(options = {}) {}
  // if VSCode understood @implements, we wouldn't have to
  // specify the type of the argument in @param as it could
  // be deducted from the interface type ;)
}
```

The `<type record>...</type>` block can be simplified to `<record>...</record>`, same with _interface_. Constructors are used very rarely.

If a type is defined without record/interface attribute, it becomes the simplest type in the _Closure_ type system called a *structural interface*, for example, `{ prop: string, prop2: (number|undefined) }`. An object like that is not nullable &mdash; since Closure tries to make JavaScript similar to Java, type nullability is a thing. More complex types, such as records and interfaces are nullable, whereas structural interfaces are not. Here's some more documentation on [types](closure-types). Therefore, when we use a record that is not expected to be nullable, we'll want to add `!` in front of it, as shown below.

Not only do we document config and return types in XML, but also the actual API contract of the library, which is placed in the *types/api.xml* file and describes all available methods that can be imported from our Node.JS library.

<highlightjs src="../example/api.xml" />

It's the core principle of _NodeTools_ to use XML to store types. You can view it as the design stage that provides a language- and tool-agnostic way to document our software, whereas JS is used for implementation later. We can reuse types for any purpose, such as creating documentation as shown later. Because types are not written in a complex proprietary format like .ts (TypeScript typings), anyone can make software that uses a simple XML parser to extract types, and build their own schema upon the existing one.
