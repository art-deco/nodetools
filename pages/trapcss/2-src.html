##! Upgrading Source Code

As the next step, I'll just download the ZIP archive from _DropCSS_ with the source code, and open finder to copy all files from source into *m*y *n*ew *p*ackage.

The original source is using _CommonJS_ however _NodeTools_ allow to program using ECMA modules with a 0-dependency regex transpiler, so we want to update the source code from `require` into imports.

```js
"use strict";

const { parse: parseHTML } = require('./html');
const { parse: parseCSS, generate: generateCSS,
  SELECTORS, stripEmptyAts } = require('./css');
const { some, matchesAttr } = require('./find');
const { postProc } = require('./postproc');
const { LOGGING } = require('./env');
```

This can be achieved easily by running the transpiler in `-r` mode:

```console
MacBook:trapcss zavr$ yarn alamode src -r
```

It will scan the *src* dir recursively, updating all files in there. By using <yarn bin-alias /> I can execute binaries from node_modules installed in the project folder.

When trying to simply check that all imports are updated correctly by running <yarn alanode>src/dropcss </yarn> that only executes all require calls without actually running the program, I see an error to do with the following:

```js
// src/find.js
function some(nodes, m) {
  return nodes.some(node => find(m, {
    idx: m.length - 1,
    node
  }));
}

export { matchesAttr };

export const some = (nodes, sel) => {
  return some(nodes, Array.isArray(sel) ? sel : parseSel(sel));
};
```

The error says:

```sh
MacBook:trapcss zavr$ yarn alanode src/dropcss.js
/Users/zavr/adc/trapcss/src/find.js:205
       const some = (nodes, sel) => {
             ^

SyntaxError: Identifier 'some' has already been declared
```

This is because after updating to imports, we acquired a name conflict. This is fixed simply by renaming the original function into `_some` and calling it from the export:

```js
// src/find.js
function _some(nodes, m) {
  // ...
}

export const some = (nodes, sel) => {
  return _some(nodes, Array.isArray(sel) ? sel : parseSel(sel));
};
```

In addition, I don't use semicolons therefore I'll quickly fix that with _ESLint_. _ESLint_ should be installed globally on the system since it's a huge binary and there's no point in installing it for each single package. If you have your own eslint config, you need to fork the template from `mnpjs/package`, define your config in there, and modify the `.mnprc` settings file to point to your forked template.

```console
MacBook:trapcss zavr$ eslint --fix src
```

As the last step for styling, I want to get rid of all `"use strict"` directives on top of each file, by a simple search and replace in _VSCode_: `"use strict"\n\n` -> "". Finally, I want the entry to the library be located at *src/index.js* instead of *src/dropcss.js*, therefore I copy the typedef from `index.js`, delete the file, and rename `dropcss.js` into `index.js`.

```js
// copy typedef as needed for next step
/**
 * @suppress {nonStandardJsDocs}
 * @typedef {import('../types').trapcss} _trapcss.trapcss
 */
```

Now I can commit all new source code into the git tree, and start testing/documenting the library.
