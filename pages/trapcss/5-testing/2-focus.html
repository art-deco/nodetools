###! Focus In Masks

To focus on a particular test, we can prepend its name with `!` in the mask result like so:

```scss
// !should retain present
#a {a:b;}

/* expected */
#a{a:b;}
/**/
```

It's also possible to focus on an entire mask, by adding `!` to the path of a mask result, or exporting the mask with `$` name:

```js
// use ! in mask result path
const contextFreeUnarySel = makeTestSuite(
  '!test/result/0-context-free-unary-sel', {
    getResults() {},
    // ...
  })

// named export with $
export const $contextFreeUnarySel = makeTestSuite(
  'test/result/0-context-free-unary-sel', {
    getResults() {},
    // ...
  })

// export with $ in object
export default {
  '$Context-free, unary selector': contextFreeUnarySel,
}
```

In _Zoroaster_, test suites are nested objects. For better reporting, we exported the default test suite as an object with the `Context-free, unary selector` property that contains the test suite generated by the mask. But we could also simply export a variable using a named export, it's just that we won't be able to report the test suite name as a sentence with whitespace and commas.
