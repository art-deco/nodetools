###! Error Stacks

Please note that if there was a run-time error in algorithms, the report will only show the location in the mask result where the test failed. Imagine that we made an mistake when creating the mask, by referencing the `.css` mask result property instead of `.input`, which evaluated to undefined, but our source code expected a string:

```scss
export const alternate = makeTestSuite(
  'test/result/alternate.scss', {
    getResults() {
      const { css } = trapcss({
        html: '<div/>',
        css: this.css,
        keepAlternate: true,
      })
      return css
    },
  })
```

We'd get the following error in the CLI:

```bash
$ zoroaster -a test/mask
 test/mask
   alternate
    ✗  !keeps the alternate comment
    | Error: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined
    |     at !keeps the alternate comment (test/result/alternate.scss:13:1)
```

The error stack has been modified to point to the location of the test in the mask result (*alternate.scss:13:1*), for convenience of navigation, but it's not a problem with inputs/outputs, but test logic. To fix this, we need to set `DEBUG=1` env variable when running tests:

```bash
bash-3.2$ DEBUG=1 yarn mask
yarn run v1.13.0
$ yarn t test/mask
$ zoroaster -a test/mask
 test/mask
   alternate
TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined

    ✗  !keeps the alternate comment
    | Error: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined
    |     at !keeps the alternate comment (test/result/alternate.scss:13:1)
```

Now we're given the full stack. As a rule of thumb, whenever you encounter an error that you don't understand in _NodeTools_, try rerunning the program with `DEBUG=1` env variable &mdash; our convention is to display full error stacks when the `DEBUG` is set. This can help fix unknown errors.

Overall, when executing new tests, we get the following report:

```bash
$ zoroaster -a test/mask/default.js
 test/mask/default.js
   @keyframes
    ✓  drops all
    ✓  drops pulse, nudge
    ✓  drops bop

    ✓  drop if unused
    ✓  drops if unused (multiple defs)

    ✓  drops if unused --font-family: should not be confused with font use
    ✓  retains if used in font-family

    |     at keeps the alternate comment (test/result/alternate.scss:1:1)

test/mask/default.js > alternate > keeps the alternate comment
  Error: 'div{text-decoration: underline;text-decoration: underline dotted;}' == 'div{text-decoration: underline;\n  /* @alternate */\n  text-decoration: underline dotted;}'
      at keeps the alternate comment (test/result/alternate.scss:1:1)

🦅  Executed 14 tests: 1 error.
```

The last error is due to the fact that the new functionality has not been implemented. But it's OK since it's in spirit of test-driven development: we added a test first, before the source code. With mask testing, the TDD methodology is easily embraced as test cases are very easy to add by simply providing new data. Instead of wasting our time on setting up test routines in JS, we can try to come up with as many use cases via masks.
