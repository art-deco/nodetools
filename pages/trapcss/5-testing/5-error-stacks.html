###! Error Stacks

Please note that if there was a run-time error in algorithms, the report will only show the location in the mask result where the test failed. Imagine that we made an mistake when creating the mask, by referencing the `.css` mask result property instead of `.input`, which evaluated to undefined, but our source code expected a string:

```scss
export const alternate = makeTestSuite(
  'test/result/alternate.scss', {
    getResults() {
      const { css } = trapcss({
        html: '<div/>',
        css: this.css,
        keepAlternate: true,
      })
      return css
    },
  })
```

We'd get the following error in the CLI:

```bash
$ zoroaster -a test/mask
 test/mask
   alternate
    ✗  !keeps the alternate comment
    | Error: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined
    |     at !keeps the alternate comment (test/result/alternate.scss:13:1)
```

The error stack has been modified to point to the location of the test in the mask result (*alternate.scss:13:1*), for convenience of navigation, but it's not a problem with inputs/outputs, but test logic. To fix this, we need to set `DEBUG=1` env variable when running tests:

```bash
bash-3.2$ DEBUG=1 yarn mask
yarn run v1.13.0
$ yarn t test/mask
$ zoroaster -a test/mask
 test/mask
   alternate
TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined

    at bb (/Users/zavr/adc/trapcss/node_modules/zoroaster/depack/bin/zoroaster.js:409:66)
    at <anonymous>
    ✗  !keeps the alternate comment
    | Error: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined
    |     at !keeps the alternate comment (test/result/alternate.scss:13:1)
```

Now we're given the full stack. As a rule of thumb, whenever you encounter an error that you don't understand in _NodeTools_, try rerunning the program with `DEBUG=1` env variable &mdash; our convention is to display full error stacks when the `DEBUG` is set. This can help fix unknown errors.
