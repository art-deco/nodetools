##! Configure Org

Packages should be organised by organisations, which can be created for free on _GitHub_ in unlimited number. Using personal repositories is also possible, in which case the name of the organisation is assumed to be the username. We'll create a new org folder in the home dir, and navigate into it:

```console
mkdir cool-org
cd cool-org
```

Here, we can run `mnp --init` again to update the settings for that particular org, however all the standard settings will be filled in already from the ones we wrote to the home directory.

```bash
GitHub access token: [8cb0f088cba5929dcd2337f906a9d8eca81d6759] # keep token
GitHub organisation: [nodetools] cool-org # update org
npm scope: [nodetools] cool-org # update scope
Default Template: [mnpjs/package] # keep default
user: [Anton] # keep
email: [anton@adc.sh] # keep
Website (for readme): [https://www.art-deco.github.io/nodetools] https://cool-org.com
Trademark (for readme): [NodeTools] Cool Org
Legal name (for license): [Art Deco Code Limited] # keep
Package Manager (yarn/npm): [yarn] # keep
```

After doing this, another `.mnprc` will be created in the `cool-org` folder, and these settings will be used for projects created in that organisation.

After _MNP_ is configured, we can proceed to creating a new package.
