##! Install MNP

The best way to start using _NodeTools_, is via <npm-badge package="mnp">MNP</npm-badge> (My New Package) &mdash; a _GitHub_ template-based package bootstrapper that allows to generate new repositories from templates and fill in the preset information into them. `mnp` has only 3 small dependencies and can be installed globally:

```sh
yarn add global mnp
npm i -g mnp
```

After it's first been installed on the system, it needs to be configured with a global settings file in the home directory. Such settings can then be updated for any other organisational directories, but in general most of the properties will stay the same. To begin the configuration process, navigate to the home dir via terminal (`cd ~`) and call `mnp --init`.

But first, a personal [access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) needs to be generated for _GitHub_ that will allow to access _GitHub_ API. The `delete_repo` and `repo` permissions are needed to create new repositories and delete them from the CLI.

```bash
GitHub access token: -new-access-token- # generated token
GitHub organisation: nodetools # either organisation or user login
npm scope: nodetools # optional scope for packages
Default Template: [mnpjs/package] # default template in org/name format
user: [Anton] # the name for package.json, read from git config
email: [anton@adc.sh] # the email for package.json, read from git config
Website (for readme): https://www.art-deco.github.io/nodetools # link to website
Trademark (for readme): NodeTools # name in footer
Legal name (for license): Art Deco Code Limited # full business name
Package Manager (yarn/npm): [yarn] # which package manager
```

These settings will be stored in the `~/.mnprc` file and read by _MNP_ upon each execution.
