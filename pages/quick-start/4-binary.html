##! Binary

_MNP_ asked us if we want to create a binary. Binaries are great for _DevOps_ to write scripts in Node.JS. Any system that has Node installed will be able to run those binaries. Even if a library was created first without a binary, it can be added later manually (by bootstrapping a new package and copying `src/bin` dir and scripts in *package.json* from there. <small>We're working on the *patch* functionality of _MNP_ that would allow to do that automatically</small>).

Packages created with binaries can be executed from the command line. The source code for executable logic is placed into the `src/bin` folder and contains a number of files:

### bin/index.js

This is the entry file for the development purposes. It's not used when the package is published. It only calls the _ÀLaMode_ handler to transpile source files on the fly, allowing to rename `imports` into `require` calls. It is also used when testing the package.

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
require('alamode')()
require('./mnp')
```

Additionally, the *package.json* will contain a number of records in the `"bin"` property:

```json
{
  "bin": {
    "example-package": "compile/bin/example-package.js",
    "example-package-dev": "src/bin/index.js"
  },
  "files": [
    "...files",
    "src/bin/index.js"
  ]
}
```

These aliases can then be called from anywhere on the system, if the package was installed globally, or via ``yarn example-package`` in other local packages that installed the binary. The *example-package-dev* binary record is used to call the binary from the local filesystem after it's been linked with `yarn link` command in the project folder. For example, you might want to go to another package folder, and execute binary from there using the `example-package-dev` command that will run the binary source code. This eliminates the need to build/compile the binary after each change, during the local development process while testing code on other packages. The `files` property will also include the pointer to the `src/bin/index.js` otherwise NPM would throw an error when trying to install our package.

### bin/example-package.js

This is the actual binary logic that will be executed. Commands can be separated by placing them into the `commands` directory, and then importing them from this file. We'll need to import args and the usage library that have been optimised for the use with _Closure Compiler_.

```js
import { _help, _init, _output, _version,
  _input, argsConfig } from './get-args'
import { reduceUsage } from 'argufy'
import usually from 'usually'

if (_help) {
  const usage = usually({
    description: 'An example package created with MNP.',
    example: 'example-package example.txt -o out.txt',
    line: 'example-package input [-o output] [-ihv]',
    usage: reduceUsage(argsConfig),
  })
  console.log(usage)
  process.exit(0)
} else if (_version) {
  console.log(require('../../package.json').version)
  process.exit(0)
}
```

### get-args.js

The arguments are generated using the ``argufy`` package that has been specifically developed to be compatible with _Closure Compiler_. All flags that are passed to binary via the `process.argv` property will be parsed and made available for export from this file. They are exported with `_` (underscore) to avoid errors when passing variables around. The arguments are generated from the `types/arguments.xml` file that describes possible flags and their types:

```xml
<arguments>
  <arg command name="input">
    The path to the input file.
  </arg>
  <arg name="output" short="o" default="-">
    Where to save the output. By default prints to stdout.
  </arg>
  <arg boolean name="init" short="i">
    Initialise in the current folder.
  </arg>
  <arg boolean name="help" short="h">
    Print the help information and exit.
  </arg>
  <arg boolean name="version" short="v">
    Show the version's number and exit.
  </arg>
</arguments>
```

When a change is made to the file, the `yarn args` command need to be run to update the *get-args* file automatically via ``argufy``. Moreover, the `reduceUsage` command is imported from ``argufy`` package also to generate help information that can be passed to ``usually`` package to display usage info to users with `-h` option.

Furthermore, it is possible to separate arguments by functionality by creating multiple *arguments.xml* files, like it's been done in [Expensive](https://github.com/artdecocode/expensive/tree/master/types/args) and [Logarithm](https://github.com/artdecocode/logarithm/tree/master/types/args) packages, however the template does not use this method. Refer to the source code of these 2 package to see how their arguments are implemented.

When developing binary locally, it can be executed with the `yarn dev -arg value -arg2` command. It will start a new Node process and run *src/bin/index* that will transpile the source-code on-the-fly. When it comes to compilation, the source code will either be transpiled into the `build` folder using _ÀLaMode_ by simply renaming imports and exports, or into the `compile` folder by executing _Closure Compiler_ via _Depack_. By compiling a binary, its dependencies will all be merged into a single JS file, which will reduce the number of prod dependencies to 0. This is discussed next.
