#![##Quick Start] NodeTools Quick Start

_NodeTools_ is a full _Node.JS_ stack which includes a number of packages for organising, testing, documenting and typing packages with JSDoc. It's very small (10 new dirs in TOTAL) and contains tools for essential operation of a package house. Dependencies that it installs provide an up-to-date development environment for local JavaScript development. It was created by a [professional Node.JS development company in London](https://www.artd.eco) to meet modern requirements for bespoke and agile _Node.JS_ development process. This guide will show how to start using the stack. If you have any questions, please refer to the [Getting Help](index#getting-help) section.
