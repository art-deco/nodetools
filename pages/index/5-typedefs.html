##! Typedefs

The advantage of TypeScript is that it provides the means for auto-completions that are required for great developer experience, and are pretty much a must for a successful package. Maintaining JSDoc has been harder, and other software like VSCode contains bugs that prevent proper working of JSDoc. But in NodeTools, this problem has been approached in a novel way: the type information is kept in XML files where interfaces and types are described. This allows to:

<ul>
  - generate and maintain JSDoc automatically from the single source of truth;
  - create externs for the compiler as they are necessary for compilation of packages that are published for external consumption;
  - embed type information into documentation in form of tables.
</ul>

NodeTools is a JavaScript stack. Although some might prefer TypeScript, possibly because of the ease of working with types, JavaScript is more favourable for other people who want to remain true to traditional JS development. With NodeTools, it becomes possible to create professional advanced packages that can scale up easily while their types come from the single source of truth, and enable the _DRY_ (don't repeat yourself) principle during the development process.
