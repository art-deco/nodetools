##! Compilation

Traditionally, packages have been transpiled while their dependencies linked dynamically via the `dependencies` field in _package.json_, which means they are pulled when the package is installed. Although possible, static linking was not a standard and required running _WebPack_ on packages, which is more of a web bundling tool. NodeTools for the first time ever allows to properly compile Node.JS packages using Closure Compiler from Google, so that a single, optimised output file is produced where dependencies are linked statically.

Static linking means that the dependencies can be moved into `devDependency` field so that other developers will be more willing to install your package. By reducing the number of dependencies to bare minimum, the installation time increases, and packages look more like finished software products, instead of raw collection of functions put together from other libraries. You still have to do the job of annotation of types and fixing type errors, as the compiler expects code to adhere to certain JSDoc standard.
