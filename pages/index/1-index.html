#![##NodeTools] NodeTools: A Complete Node.JS Development Stack

Every developer needs tools to work with the programming language. For JavaScript and Node.JS, the choice of such tools is usually fairly standard and might consists of things like Babel, TypeScript, Mocha and React. However, the complexity of such tools does not allow to feel in control of the development process as they require installation of thousands of new packages in the `node_modules` directory and make the developer adhere to their mode of work instead of allowing her to just use the language for programming.

_NodeTools_ is the simplest, full stack for developing libraries and binaries in Node.JS that is a complete replacement to the tools that are all over the place. It will only create 10 folders in the `node_modules` directory, the exact purpose of which will be known to the developer. Such advantage allows to initialise packages very quickly, without having to link thousands of dependencies.

    Our [Node.JS development company in London](https://www.artd.eco) has created _NodeTools_ for our own use that requires maximum efficiency, productivity and developer experience while developing in Node.JS. We deliver products for the web using JavaScript, as it's the most suitable language for asynchronous operations that take the central stage in web computing, so we created a stack to make sure it's really easy to create and publish new packages, web apps and static websites quickly.
