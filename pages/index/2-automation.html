##! Automation

The key focus of NodeTools is to reduce the number of repetitive operations to the minimum, while allowing the developer to keep her personal style of programming. We're not trying to tell you how to organise source code, or how to code. We only want to automate those operations that take a large amount of time, and provide tools for the best developer experience.

Packages' modularity is in the core of NPM infrastructure. It's great that everything can be split by package, including simplest functions. But it usually takes time to initialise those packages and repositories for them. It's really time consuming, but not with the package bootstrap from NodeTools. After setting it up locally with your GitHub developer key, you'll be able to generate new packages from our, or your own GitHub templates in a matter of seconds, and use the freed time wisely to produce more amazing code.
