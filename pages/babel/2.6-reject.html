##! Promise&lt;Open Source&gt;.reject()

Going back to the _the promise of open source is better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in_, so far we can draw the following conclusions:

<ul>
  - *Better quality* is not a thing since _JSDoc_ is essential to the development process. You can't not have functions annotated properly (`@param`, an occasional `@example`) if you publish your package. A transpiler MUST keep _JSDoc_ in the proper place, if it doesn't that means the transpiler is of low-quality since it doesn't even have tests for _JSDoc_.
  - *Higher reliability* is a myth because even though the issue was filed, with screenshots and explanations, it was ignored totally for the amount of time equal to one and a half years, even after version 7 went out of beta.
  - *Lower cost* is actually higher, because of the time wasted again and again to install 250 dependencies (if `Babel` is a compiler, why can't it compile itself into a single dependency?)
  - and finally, perhaps the most unintuitively, *an end to predatory vendor lock-in* becomes...
</ul>
