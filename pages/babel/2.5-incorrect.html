##! Incorrect placement of JSDoc comments #8437

That's the title and number of the [second issue](incorrect-placement) because the first one was removed since it was "insulting". In *BABEL R U UK* I didn't use swear words to call authors names to make it insulting, it was primary "all caps", asking "wat is wrong with you". This one person goes "fill issue template so that we can help you", another one says "Rude issues aren't the way to get help" &mdash; mateys, it's ``Babel`` who needs urgent help OK not me? Yet because they think their software is so popular, everyone's coming to them to beg for help, isn't. This bug freaked me out because for months I'd been trying to understand why do my hints go away after publishing, but it also made me really angry because:

<ul>
  - I'm a Senior Software Developer with a BSc/Masters degrees in Computer Science yet people who are not even qualified in CS think that I come to them to ask for help;
  - I'm passionate and obsessional about quality, what is there to say of quality of a program that doesn't include any tests for 1/2 of the whole JS which JSDoc is;
  - I finally understood why _JSDoc_ was not showing in the editor properly for my own packages, and while all that time I thought it was somehow me doing something wrong, my only fault was in using that awful piece of _free_ software called ``Babel``;
  - There's nobody who would tell them off for that offense, there's no Open Source quality assurance commission that would shame an essential piece of _Node.JS_ infrastructure for how they treated me and my work. What there is, is `Handshake` who gave them a $100k cheque SIMPLY because they are so known.
  - Follows from the above, what about taking some responsibility instead of only bragging about how many people use your software, collecting donations from fellow developers who trust you?
</ul>

This bug is everything what is wrong with this unprofessional industry called poser Open Source. It finally established my attitude towards so-called "community" where no responsibility is ever taken by anyone and my *freedom* of writing documentation using _JSDoc_ was taken away from me by software that I was extorted into using by _Node.JS_'s inability to JUST make ES6 modules happen for 4 years. `NearForm`, where were you with your [5-day design sprints](https://www.nearform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NearForm_5_Day_Design_Sprint-1.pdf) all these years? `NearForm` is another organisation that prides itself on being so _Open Source_, yet look at the havoc they both have wreaked upon us.

Let's have a look at the the first comment from a maintainer on that new issue:

      Your previous issue was closed because its tone was insulting. This one is too: it's not just about avoiding all-caps. Babel is used by thousands of production-grade projects, many of which use doc comments to generate their documentation. With a bit of humility, you may have recognized that maybe you are missing something instead of immediately calling the maintainers incompetent.<br><br>
      Now, to answer you issue: the output you see is expected behavior (*Edit*: See below, I agree that it's worse than in Babel 6). Output generated by Babel is no longer source code (by definition, it's generated content): it is not intended to act as source code. Comments are emitted on a best effort basis to help readability when debugging the output file. Babel output should be treated similarly to machine code: you do not generate documentation from machine code but from the source.<br><br>
      The input you pass to your documentation generation tool should be the the source code with ES-next syntax, not the lowered Babel output.

So what I called somebody incompetent. Are you being paid $10k per month by your sponsors, yet you can't add a test for essential JSDoc? It's in the job spec of every developer to write tests for her code. If she's not doing it, she's incompetent as it's her direct responsibility. But OFC you can't criticise anyone on the internet, right? If it was a fair enough small overlooked bug I obviously wouldn't get so emotional, but _JSDoc_ is absolutely crucial. Everyone needs _JSDoc_. I'm only reacting like that because I care about JS. And look how well people who attend JS committee meetings to "participate in discussion of various proposals", take care of us Are they competent? How about they write some tests first prior to that meetings.

<block-quote background="#fff6c5">"Babel is used by *thousands* of *production-grade* projects"</block-quote>

Which makes the situation even more sad...

<block-quote style="background: #fff6c5;">I also want to remind you that Babel is supported by a small team of volunteers. If you want to improve things, you can help and send PRs. You are not entitled to free support and insults are not tolerated.</block-quote>

Well what you did to my _JSDoc_ is insulting to me, and I have to tolerate it because you hide behind the fact that you're volunteering, but so is everyone else, yet nobody gets paid as much as you do, and not even via paid support for which I can't blame you, but via donations like that Handshake's $100k (yet Handshake's not even using `Babel`).

<!-- OK perhaps I'm not entitled to support unless I contribute moneys, but the [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/babel) page states that 2 hours of support goes only to the most advanced contribution tier, called "Base Support Sponsor" for $24k a year. OK Babel you've charged _AirBnb_ and _AMP_ for 4 hours of your support $4k (24/12 * 2) in August, so the rest $19k must have been spent on maintenance, such as fixing bugs? OK you didn't know about that bug in August 2018. Today is Feb 2020, you've been paid $100k by `Handshake`, and you still haven't fixed the issue? I don't care how you get paid, I don't use your software, but everyone can now see how things are. -->

<block-quote style="background: #fff6c5;">Looking at it closer, this seems to be a regression introduced during the Babel 7 beta.<br>
A simple workaround would be to use a stable version of Babel (Babel 6).<br>
It's not good that this regression happened, but it's why Babel 7 is still in *beta*. Thanks for reporting issues on the beta release, but there's *no need to get mad if you use unstable versions*. This will probably be fixed until the stable release.</block-quote>

<plate alt="babel issue comment complaining about non-beta version" src="img/one-year/unstable.png">Unstable version they say... Babel 7 went out of beta since actually August 27, 2018.</plate>
<plate alt="babel issue comment saying how a person had to change entire built system to typescript because of babel" src="img/one-year/alamode/typescript.png">Just as I was writing this article, another comment appeared highlighting exactly all of my concerns here.</plate>


<plate alt="2 Babel maintainers getting paid almost $100.000 on Open Collective" src="img/one-year/100k.png">Why are you not fixing the bug?</plate>

<!-- I will abstain from commenting further because then this entire page will have to be marked as "disruptive", towards both "volunteers" (maintainers <small>cashing in 10k a month khm-khm each</small>) and contributors willing to pay this money for such reliable software. Is it really wrong of me to show negative attitude towards this state of affairs? Just one last thing I want to bring up here, is that the Babel's maintainers get "to be involved in the process that moves various JavaScript proposals forward" (Open Collective's landing). Yet we have bugs like that. -->

I believe that essential requirements need to be met first, before working on proposals. There are clear requirements for a transpiler: to change imports to `module.exports`, while keeping everything else intact. Making software is profession for some, so stop making a joke out of it already. When you want to brag about being the most popular tool, you're more than happy to do that, but now everyone knows what's really happening quality-wise. You're so detached from reality because of your fame that you even started calling your software a compiler which it is not! Only _NodeTools_ provide a way to properly compile _Node.JS_ packages.

<!-- For comparison, *Bootstrap* [receives](https://opencollective.com/bootstrap) only £3k yearly, arguably being the second most important piece of the web infrastructure after _Babel_. A picture is worth a thousand words: -->
