- Felix BÃ¶hm's [nth-check](https://github.com/fb55/nth-check) - it's not much code, but getting `An+B` expression testing exactly right is frustrating. I got part-way there before discovering this tiny solution.
- Vadim Kiryukhin's [vkbeautify](https://github.com/vkiryukhin/vkBeautify) - the benchmark and test code uses this tiny formatter to make it easier to spot differences in output diffs.
