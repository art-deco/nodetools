#![##TrapCSS 2] TrapCSS2: Advanced NodeTools

In the previous part, we looked at the first steps in creating a new package with _NodeTools_ stack. During the initialisation process with `mnp`, we were asked some questions like if we wanted to compile the package, if a binary should be added and whether _GitHub_ wiki should be created. We answered yes to all three questions, so let's get on with the second part of the tutorial.

## Compilation Step

Prior to _NodeToos_, the industry standard was to simply transpile source code with _Babel_, or not use module at all and avoid transpilation step together. The first option is not good because _Babel_ is a package with 200+ dependencies that jam our `node_modules`, and also because for years it's been disparaging professional software engineering values that are in core of _NodeTools_, such as respect for _JSDoc_, as can be read in the <a href="babel" /> article.
