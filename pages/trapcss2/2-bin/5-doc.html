###! CLI Documentation

I want to let my users know how to use _TrapCSS_ from the *CLI*. Without _NodeTools_, I'd have to manually execute the binary, and copy-paste the help output into the README file. But we want to automate this process, to

<ol>
  - Save time taken to manually copy-paste data between terminal and documentation;
  - Prevent documentation from becoming out-of-date when changes are made;
  - Detect any errors if there were problems with the binary;
  - Turn documentation into specification as our program will now always confirm to the published contract.
</ol>

The template already included *documentary/2-CLI/index.md* file, but we want to build upon it a little bit, by giving a more precise example. We'll need to create *example/cli/index.html* and *example/cli/style.css* files with some input data:

```html
<!-- example/cli/index.html -->
<html>
  <head>
    <title>TrapCSS ftw</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <p>Hello World!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
/* example/cli/style.css */
html {
  background: yellow;
  /* @alternate */
  background: green;
}
.card {
  padding: 8px;
}
p:hover a:first-child {
  color: red;
}
```

The updated CLI section of the documentation is pretty simple and includes a 2-column table that lists the examples, and the output. The table with arguments will also be included automatically by the ``argufy`` component that comes with _Documentary_:

<highlightjs src="../example/help.markdown" />


We then give a console line of how to run our binary, and include the ``%FORK-css%`` marker, which means that the language of the output block will be CSS for syntax-highlighting on _GitHub_.

<p>
  <img border rounded img-fluid src="./img/bin-doc.png" alt="CLI documentation section" placeholder-auto />
</p>

The README section is now compiled in the most automated way possible, leaving us time to work on implementation, testing and new feature design. Remember that we can run <yarn doc>-p "doc cli"</yarn> to keep _Documentary_ running in watch mode, and automatically push any changes upstream.
